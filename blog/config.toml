# ============ HUGO SETTINGS ============

# Hugo occasionaly caluclates absolute links (even when the realtive ones would do),
# to allow sites start not at the root of a daomain.
# But since I have an entire subdomain, I can just set this to "/",
# which has an additional benifit of not requiring me to change this param
# every time I want to launch the site without https or on localhost.
# (Commenting this line out or setting it to "" seems to have the same effect).
baseURL = "/"
title = "SKлад постов"
theme = "anubis"

cleanDestinationDir = true

# TODO: https://youtu.be/1iTnkzdt1mw?t=7
# enableRobotsTXT = true

# Hugo serves static files directly at the site root
# with seemingly no option to alter this behavior.
# https://gohugo.io/content-management/static-files/
# Huh. But whatever.


# Minify some of the stuff.
# Sadly, Hugo decided to name these params `disableCSS`, `disableHTML`, etc. (with the default = `false`)
# instead of having `minifyCSS`, `minifyHTML`, etc. (with the default value of `true`).
# So you kinda have to deal with this double negation now.
# Then there's also the `minifyOutput` flag.
# When set to `false` (which is its default value),
# it disables minification completely, overriding all other params.
# Needlessly convoluted, but fortunately not that hard to figure out thanks to the docs:
# https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#configure-minify

# === CSS ===
style = "dark-without-switcher"
# A proper way to add sustom CSS would be to put the file into the `assets/` directory
# and then add a leave a relative path to it here:
# customCSS = ["css/scratch.css"]
# But this makes Anubis include the contents of the file into the big `main.css`
# instead of adding another `<link rel="stylesheet" ... />` to the HTMLs.
# This might be a better approach than serving custom CSS files from `static/`
# (considering Hugo probably won't minify static files, won't generate integrity checks, etc.),
# but I want my CSS as a separate file, so instead I overwrite `layouts/partials/head-extra.html`.
